Good Morning everyone. As we are in the final couple of week of the year, I am expecting the price action to be quite slow. As such, I am going to use this time to get away from the screens and focus on some other projects. The whole point of trading is to be able to get away to do other things you are interested in. 

I highly recommend everyone find some time to take a break and enjoy other things. We will be back next year with daily updates. I wish everyone a happy holiday season.
