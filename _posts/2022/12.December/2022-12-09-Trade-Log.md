## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
3955 has been a responsive level. Took a short against this level using the seller at A's high as an out. Had a target of -1 SD and trailed my stop to this level. A bit too tight as target was hit but overall a good trade that was managed well. 

#### Trade 2
Took a short against VWAP where there was a little supply. Once it start breaking I trailed my stop into profit and secured a nice win. Not earth shattering gains, but happy with my risk management on these trades so far. 

#### Trade 3
Took a long against VWAP. Was targeting a test of the highs but trailed my stop. I am starting to recognize today that VWAP is being traded through in both direction ("vwap shuffle"). Goof out and lucky to make money today
