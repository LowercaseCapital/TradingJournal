# TLDR
Market is still digesting the rapid change in prices. Nonfarm payrolls data is out at 830a and Fed Evans is speaking at 1015a. An increase in volatility is expected around this time. Once that is done, we could see some nice price action. Sitting in the middle of 4050 and 4100 in balance so we will look to see which side gets tested and what we do when we get there. I plan to rely on MGI today. 


# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 68% Short. 

Yesterday's session was unsurprisingly balanced. After such a strong move on Wednesday balance is not unusual as the market digests the new prices. Balance yesterday developed inside of T+2 value. We did look inside of L single prints but were unable to fill them indicating a short position underneath is. As it did not fill we can carry this reference forward. Some periods saw strong moves but ultimately little changed. More time may be needed in this area to further digest the prices. 

The Globex session was very condensed and saw value develop inside of yesterdays balance area. Nothing notable to discuss other than the lack of movement. 

Looking ahead into today there is nonfarm payrolls which could have an impact on the days volatility. Fed Evans is speaking at 10:15 which could also cause some price movement.
