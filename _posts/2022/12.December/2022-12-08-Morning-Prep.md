# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 69% Long

Yesterday's profile put in an odd looking b shape where value developed inside of Tuesdays value near the lows and at the bottom of the 3939-4042 balace zone. We repeatedly spent time around 3940s but failed to get a meaningful push lower. 

Globex session looked below yesterdays low and failed to accept lower prices. An hour before the open we are pushing to the overnight high and nearing yesterdays high. 

There is significant news out with Jobless Claims this morning but once printed not too much high impact news today. Once we see the reaction we can develope a plan for the day. Key level is the balance low, and yesterdays low. Failure to accept under those levels and we could have a very hard time pushing lower.
