## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
Short at SD2 after a failure to hold 4100. Was looking to back test the SD1 but no bid at that level and I decided to frontrun vwap. Wonderful trade, and I am happy that I trailed my stop when my target offered no support. Not much to else to say here but a great start to the day. With endless news, this could be it for the day. 

#### Trade 2
Short 4052. Inventorected a little bit and ran into an area of supply. Took the short against the 144sma. Took 1/2 off quicky for 6 ticks whicah allowed me to reduce my risk. The second half i flattened ahead of my target as there was data at 945a and I did not want have a position when the data was released.  Overall good trade

#### Trade 3
Short at the -SD1 at 4048. This area showed some response and with a tightend stop, I was able to take this trade with confidence. Took a quick out for 6 ticks and front ran the open on the 2nd contract. Could have held on but trailing stop in chop is okay for better risk management.
