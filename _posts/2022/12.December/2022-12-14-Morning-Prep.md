# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 73% Long. 

After starting the day with a significant gap caused by the CPI number A period put in the high of the day and went trend down and filled the gap to the tick. Notably we did not spend anytime inside of Mondays range. That said, we now are back inside our balance range hovering around the top edge of this zone. This could be an important area today. 

Globex session contined to spend time near the close and was balanced inside of yesterdays range and value.  Today is a FED day so expect some chaos this afternoon at 2EST and through J POW the press conference in the always entertaining J period.
