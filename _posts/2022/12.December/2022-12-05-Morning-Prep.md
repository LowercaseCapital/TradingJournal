# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 63% Short. 

Fridays Session gapped down then filled the gap. We Developed overlapping to lower value as the day progressed. Notably we tested the upper edge of the balance area that we had just broken out of. For now, we have looked back into this range and failed but any push lower with acceptance could see us back into this range. 

Globex session was pretty condensed with an overall tight range. Currently we are near the lower edge of the range. The entirety of the session occurred within Fridays value area. This should lead us to expect chop if we open in this area. Still in the beginning of the month so we need to let this develop. Friday's value area high and low are the first references on either side of the current price. This may give us some indication of what is to come as the day progresses.
