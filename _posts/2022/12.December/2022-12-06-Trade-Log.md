#### Trade 1
Took a short that was a bit too early in A. Saw a failure to get over vwap and a bid response at 02 that was weakening. Covered at a high volume node, as I did not have confidence that supply would continue. 
#### Trade 2
Took a short on a failure to get back to -SD1. This took a bit of time to play out. I am very short biased but that seems to be the overall direction. Trailed my stop and took 3pts out. Really good trade, well managed. Should probably have held on but risk management is the priority. Not a bad out trailing my stop.
