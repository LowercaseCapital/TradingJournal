## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
Short at SD2 after a failure to hold 4100. Was looking to back test the SD1 but no bid at that level and I decided to frontrun vwap. Wonderful trade, and I am happy that I trailed my stop when my target offered no support. Not much to else to say here but a great start to the day. With endless news, this could be it for the day.
