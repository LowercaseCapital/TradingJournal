# TLDR
Incredible move up yesterday during and after Powell spoke. Globex held on to the gains made. A lot more data toady, look to see if we find acceptance up here. If we do see continuation higher, our ultimate target due to breaking out of balance is 4250. Heading into the final months of the year is this a year end markup?


# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 98% Short. But keep this is context given yesterdays price action.

Yesterday's session saw an incredible move once Fed Chair Powell began speaking. What he said is not really important but its is safe to say we found a bid. Due to this, value yesterday is completely higher, We filled the single I single prints from Nov 28th and the gap from Nov 28th and proceeded to find our way into the gap from September 13th. This gap fills at 4104 so that is a level to watch. We closed the day having gone trend and left 3 sets of single prints in its wake. These we will carry forward (4044.25, 4008.75, 3970.75).

Taking a step back we broke out of balance, however not the direction I expected. From the bottom of balance yesterday, we exploded through our upper bound of 4042 and closed comfortably above it. Using the double balance method, we would look to 4250 as the ultimate target. I would not expect this level immediately but should we accept higher levels, this should not be ruled out. 

Globex is currently balance inside of the M price probe and the larger gap from september. We hae additional data today including jobless claims, PMI  and a few Fed Speakers. We could see some volatility again
