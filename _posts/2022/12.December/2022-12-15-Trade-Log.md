## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
After missing a few shorts I waited until W put in a low and moved off of it. With low volume on the push down and short inventory I took a long in an area that was seeing a bid. I had a clear out at the lows should it have not worked and decided to take it off at 78 as we were failing to get the push at the time. Hindsight - I could have let thet trade work up to 

#### Trade 2
Saw VPOC move down to neat the low of the session. Price was also in an area I had previously identified as support. Quick long using the low as an out. Trailed stop to 70.25 as I am still quite short biased.
