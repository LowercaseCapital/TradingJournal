# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 93% Long. 

Yesterday's session turned out to be somewhere between a balance day and a P shape profile. Notably A period put in a decent amount of excess and set the low of the session. Yesterdays value developed completely higher than Wednesdays value and after 5 consecutive down days we seem to have confirmed our balance low for the time being. Both Wednesday and Thursday attempted to push and accept below 3040 and both failed to get extension. Use caution though, after giving back the entirety of the Fed move, we are right back to where we started... in balance. Nothing is decided but it gives to something to look for going forward. 

Globex session pushed above yesterdays high with value that developed overlapping to higher. As we look to todays session, the key question is will we open on a gap? Should we do so, the question becomes does it hold. If not this push up off the balance low could just be a correction to the short inventory over the last 6 days. Nothing is decided yet but it is a scenario to consider. 

PPI data that could shake things up this morning is out at 830a. Be carful around this time as it could bring some volatility.
