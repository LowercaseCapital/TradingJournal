# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 72% Short. 

After a gap down, yesterday turned out to be a b shaped profile spending the bulk of time  and closing below our balance low of 3938. Globex continiued to drive down and positioned ES to open on a gap. Today we should keep an eye on the 3900 level. Today is options expiration and there is significant risk to the downside shoud we fail to regain 3900s. As alwasy let MGI be the guide.
