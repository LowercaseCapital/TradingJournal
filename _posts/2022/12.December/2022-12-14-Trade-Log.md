## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1

Took a premarket long just under the 1st -SD1 (4051). Although inventory is long, I saw supply at the lows dwindling.  Risk is that we cannot accept over the -SD1 and this is a bit early but I like the odds for a push towards vwap should we accept over v period high. After taking out v high, this trade did not really move. Although premarket trades can be SLOOOOOW this just keeps retested my entry.  Good trade entry location that is within 1pt of the SD is helping keep the trade on for now. After close to 20m, I closed the trade for 1pt profit at 4052. The idea is still valid but the continuous struggle and selling into buying at these levels to get back over the previous close with long inventory makes me thing this could come back in towards the low. There is clearly a seller above at this point and just going to manage the risk on it.  Taking a point of profit is fine for a trade that quite honestly just isn't working like I expected (Timing is everything). It may go without me but there will be more opportunities later. 

### Trade 2
Had been looking to short around SD1 but did not love the price action at the time. Once we got to SD2 (4067) and had supply I was about to take the short ahead of it. Good trade location and was looking for the larger move back to VWAP. When we failed to get acceptance under the 1st SD (again) I put my stop at 4064 and was taken. Not a bad trade. Didn't hit my full target but managed the risk in chop. Could have held on for the move but no harm in taking it off. Good trade +3 for a +4 on the day.

### Trade 3
Took a short against SD2 and the supply at 75. Buying was too sticky and was just too soon. Stop got hit, I still think this will come in more but timing was just a bit off.

### Trade 4
Retook the short as the buying was not convincing. Took -3 loss buying is sticky but I am not seeing a continued push up that I would expect. Need to wait now for better opportunities.  

### Trade 5
Took a short 4077. Stopped 4080. Should have waited on this but it wasn't the worst given the lack of push 

#### Trade 6
Horrible trading. I got really stubborn and took a bigger loss than I should have. Had opportunities for profit but did not get to my target. Which should have been a sign we ran out of supply.  This trade is all sorts of mismanaged. Calling it a day after this one. FED later is another reason to stay out. I held this trade for far too long, maybe some revenge trading from my previous stops? The day doesn't kill me but its a good example of getting stubborn and it costing a bit more than it should have.
