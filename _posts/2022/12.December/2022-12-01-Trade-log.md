## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
Short at SD2 after a failure to hold 4100. Was looking to back test the SD1 but no bid at that level and I decided to frontrun vwap. Wonderful trade, and I am happy that I trailed my stop when my target offered no support. Not much to else to say here but a great start to the day. With endless news, this could be it for the day. 

#### Trade 2
Took a short on a failure to stay above VWAP. Target was to retest the -SD1. Front rant the target near ON low by trailing stop fairly tightly on a move with some momentum. Really nice entry, could have possibly been closer to vwap, but was withing risk tolerance. Nice exit by trailing.
