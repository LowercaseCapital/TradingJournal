# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 90% Short. 

Yesterday's trading began above our previously established balance zone and after Sr. Powell took the mic the price action got weird. proceeding to sell off, bounce and sell off again. After the dust settled we closed the day just inside the top edge of our balance range. 

The globex session continued the selling down below the very important 4000 level and currently has us hovering around 3990. 4000 is a very visual level and with OPEX tomorrow could be something we spend some time around over the next 24 hours.
