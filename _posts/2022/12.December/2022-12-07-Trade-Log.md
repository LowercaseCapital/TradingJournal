## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
Short the first test of VWAP. Pre market was took the quick point as it was not the best time of day to be holding a trade into the open.

### Trade 2
Short 3945 against the +1 SD. This was scratched.

#### Trade 3
Short a break of the previous close at 3942.5. Trailing my stop a bit too tight mainly due to poor trade location. If I had better trade location, I could have trailed my stop above vwap and given it the room necessary to hold until my target near the open was hit. This trade is a good example of balancing risk management and holding a trade until the target is hit. That is okay that I was stopped at vwap but this trade emphasizes the importance of good trade location.

#### Trade 4
Short on the failure for C period to take out A high and then coming back and accepting inside of B's range. Trailed stop too tight. I need to let these play out longer sometimes, but small wins adding up. 


#### Trade 5
Decent short entry above vwap. Had opportunity to cover 38, but tried to hold out for the open. Stop over vwap was taken. Adding another small win for a decent day.
