# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 61% Short. 

Yesterday's trend day down was a slow and methodical grid. One time framing down the entire day until M period finally ended it. We took back all of the single prints from Nov 30th and left a set to carry forward from B period. This set will fill at 3976.5. Only a 6 wide point of control was established. This and the single prints that held indicate supply above. Look to see if that continues today and throughout the week. 

Globex session continued the methodical selling and pushed below the previous low by 7 points. As it currently stands we are at risk of opening on a gap down but this could go either way. Should we open in 3910-20 area the gap would not be too large and with short inventory we could see it fill right away. Keep this is mind as the market opens. 

Again today there is not a lot of news not too much news on the horizon. Mainly there is Nonfarm productivity and labor costs at 8030a.  

Overall I still remain short biased, but I do see some potential to correct inventory early on. 3900 is a very significant level. I would expect to see some buying in this area. Should the supply overwhelm buying in this area we could see a significant push lower with increased volatility. I will continue to pick my spots for trades as risk management is the most important strategy for long term success.
