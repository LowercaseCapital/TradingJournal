## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
Pre marekt 1 contract short at -SD2. While this is not a typcical short entry for me, we rejected -SD1 just prior and I was looking for a retest of the low. With clear supply above, long inventory and a defined stop, this fits my plan for the day.  Covered when a new low was made and failed to get extenstion. This was good risk management with news coming in the next 10m-15m. Nice start up 3pts. 

#### Trade 2
Took a short in an area of supply. I was a but too early on my entry but I had 2 levels above me that failed to trade, with a 4-5 pt stop (admitidly a bit wide), but both failed to trade giving me confidence to stay in the trade. Once the bid at 70 broke and had some follow through, trailed my stop. Trade was managed well once it started to work, need to be a bit more patient entering and that could have been a perfect trade.

#### Trade 3
Took a short at the ON low against -SD1. Quick flush 2 pts but ended up scratching.  Risk management is key here. No need to force things. Scratch was okay.

#### Trade 4
After another push up and failure to get to VWAP, I took the same trade again, Short 3966 and this time trailed my stop much quicker. 2 point win here is okay, as after my stop was taken we pushed up to VWAP. There is a lack up supply down here and failing to get continutation.  Small wins adding up today, have to be quick as it is a bit choppy and there is not a lot of continuation.

#### Trade 5
After spening most of A and B period under VWAP. I began to see a clear lack of supply under the ON low. We failed repeatedly to get to yesterdays poor low. Finally late in B period we tested VWAP and cleared the 144 sma. This level held for a bit and allowed me to take a long at VWAP. My traget was the +SD1 and +SD2 should a stop run push us quickly into the single pritns from yesterday. While we got into them, I trailed my stop pretty close and was able to exit just under the +SD1. This was well executed and well managed. Risk was minimal ~4pts should the 144sma break. Sold into the move in the singles right at my target. This did require patience and I was a bit early at 73 given I could have eneted 71 a min after my entry. But within my risk tolerance so I am happy with my execution and the result.
