# TLDR
News, News, News. Today is full of high impact news. Refer to the schedule below of medium to high impact news. Be carful as high volitality should be expected. 

# Notes
- Inventory is 90% Long

- Yesterday's session saw overlapping to lower value develop throughout the day. Although tested the single prints from Monday (11/28) I period were not filled. This indicates there is supply in this area. Carry this area forward as yesterday confimred their relavance. Taking a longer term view I see a balance area from 3940 to 4045. Yesterday tested the bottom of this area but stopped just short of looking below this area. This is something to watch going forward espically heading into what could be a volitale news cycle.

Globex is currently balance but data releases before the open are likely to change that. We have a poor high in the globex session and a 17 wide poc. Nothing of significance here until data is released. Expect volitality to pick up. My plan today is to be patient and wait for periods which are tradable after the initial bursts in volitality. Likely will have to take profits quickly as high volitality can knock you out of a trade.
