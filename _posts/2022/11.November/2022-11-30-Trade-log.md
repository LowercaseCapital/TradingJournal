## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
Pre marekt 1 contract short at -SD1. After inital burst of orderflow, price got stuck around -SD1. Took a short against this level. Spent some time here and decided it wa best to take it off as it did not do what i expected when it did push lower. Risk manamgent is key here. Ill take the small win and wait for better oppertunities in a day full of news events. 

#### Trade 2
Short right at VAWP as inventory was long and supply stepped in. As we expected a correction lower, and supply stepped in, this was a low risk short with a fairly tight stop. Target was the open but it was front run. Took it off for 3 points. Data at 945 so needed to be in and out pretty quickly as to not get stuck in volitality before it is released. Good entry and good risk management
#### Trade 3
Short at -SD1. Price stuck right here too long and took the trade off to manage risk ahead of JOLTS data at 10a. Managed the risk here. 

#### Trade 4
Short once we broke 55 which was a responsive bid. Not the best entry between SDs. But +2 and managed the risk. 

#### Trade 5
Long -SD2 once we came back to 3950 level which had a buyer. A bit too ealry but held B low. Had trouble holding above -SD1 so moved stop to this level and was taken. Once I exited price came back to my entry. This was managed well. 

#### Trade 6
Long at VWAP against E's low. Tight stop. Price looked above the open but did not hold. Okay to get stopped here espically on a day that was full of news. Powell speking 20+ after that trade, so I did not want to get stuck in this trade. Ultimate target was SD1 butno harm in taking a little bit of profit here.
