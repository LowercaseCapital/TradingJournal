# TLDR
Yesterday Markets found some supply after an early correction higher. After one time framing down most of the morning, markets made a second inventory correction in E and F periods, before pushing lower throughout the rest of the afternoon. Closing the day with one set of single prints from 3983.25 to 3977. This altrhough time was spent there in the Globex session, we can look to see if there remains supply in this area and look for a rotation lower. Opening Regular Trading Hours (RTH) below the T+2 low with supply above puts emphesis on the Prev Days low. Should this level break with volume, there is potential for additional margin call selling. 

Inventory this morning is long. Odds  do favor a correction lower. Orderflow in RTH will be the guide today with the Single Prints above and yesterdays low as our first references. As always the market is dynamic and can change quickly. Be aware of the news listed below as that could impact volitality and cause larger moves that violate the structure that has developed in the last 2 days.

# Globex Review
- Inventory is 95% Long
-  Overnight sessionb built value inside of the I single prints from yesterday. Profile looks to be a bell curve with valid but not meaningful excess on both sides with the bulk of time spent in the middle.  The Globex session has 2 tick of excess on the low made early on in the evening. Altrhough not a poor low, this is an indication that there may be buyers in the 3970 area. Yesterdays M and L low are poor which clearly shows the lack of supply near 3960 with a failue to test that level in the Globex session.
