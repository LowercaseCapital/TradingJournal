## Detailed Trade Review

#### Trade 1
Pre marekt 2 contract long. This was taken just off the 144sma (1m). Very tight stop and a nice trade for a quick profit. ES backed away from 04 so this was a great out and great entry against a level. Inventoy was short giving me an oppertunity to play a corection. Even though it was not significant.

#### Trade 2
Push up into the open and price stalled around 4010. Took the short a little bit ahead of +SD1. Buyers stepped in and I was stopped at at 14. Risk was managed so this is okay. But needed to be more patient early in A period.

#### Trade 3
After getting stopped reevaluted, there was supply over 14 that kept us from heading back towards the high. Still beleived short was the play as pre marekt analysis told me inventory was short, and a correction up was likely. This trade worked out really well but took quite a bit of time and began a sequence were moves were working but patience was required. In hindsight this trade was covered too soon. However, I had grown impatent holding the short and not breaking below 10, when it finally happened my stop got moved down, taken then a move lower occured. Oh well. Risk was managed and that is the most important part. 

#### Trade 4
Looking to capatilize on the missed move from covering too soon, and knowing there were sellers at 4008, I took another short, with a very very tight stop. Another in hindshight this was too close of a stop given the micro chop we had seen. Oh well small loss and risk was limited. 

#### Trades 5 and 6
Trades 5 and 6 were both short, seeing the supply above I attempted to innovate a short at 06 (which had buyers and was near vwap) but had been tested a number of times. I was stopped at 07.25 but 09 offered a better entry after another push higher and fail. Took the short there and was able to cover when 06 finally broke. I was pretty happy to call it a day here but was paying attention in the event other oppertunities presetned. 

#### Trade 7 
This was the best trade of the day. Long right as price stablizied after a quick fluxh around -SD2. Was initally targeting -SD1 and VWAP. But given it was duing "Fed Speakers" I was a bit more conserative. This was the trade of the day. Very little risk using another break of -SD2 or even a move towards -SD3 was acceptable risk. Worked very quickly and was able to sell into the strength on the move back to vwap. Really great trade near perfect entry, well managed, and hit my target even though it was sold a bit ahead of VWAP.
