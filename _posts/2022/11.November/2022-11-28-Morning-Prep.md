# TLDR
Welcome back after as short holiday break. Last Thursday the equities market as closed so we can safely pretend Thursday's trading never happend. After all no settlemnt. This means that T+2 is Wednesday's session. Following 1/2 a session on Friday the market is gap down and at the moment, attempting to test under the T+2 low at 4003.25. Should selling volume increase under this level it could lead to margin call selling. We do have some news at 10:30a and during the Fed Speech could have an impact on volitality. It is best to let this play out without a position. Oppertunities will exist both before and after. Inventory is 100% short so initally I am looking for a slight correctiuon. How much of a correction remains to be seen. As we noted last week, its okay to take profit too soon. These wins will add up and staying mentally focused will keep you in the game to catch a nice oppertunity to make your day. 

As usual, we will look to pick our spots early on. Hit and run trading until we have a better idea what incoming order flow will bring us.
