You found me. Welcome to my site. This is (hopefully) the first post of many. My goal for this site is to document things that I learn as part of my trading journey. I am an S&P 500 futures trader focused mostly on the intraday timeframe. I plan to post my notes before the day begins as a way to force myself to really do my homework prior to each day. At the end of the day I will post a summary of my activity with a brief explanation of what I was thinking at the time. 

Trading is all about managing risk. So that is my focus before thinking about profit. As someone once told me, it is not about the money you make, it is all about the money you keep. 

I know this was brief, but in two days our journey begins. Until then enjoy the holiday weekend.
