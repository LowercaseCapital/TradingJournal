# Single Prints
A market profile distribution that is split into two distributions that are separated by single prints. The general rule of thumb is to treat each distribution as if it were a separate day. Judge the current day’s bullishness or bearishness by which of the prior day’s distributions you find acceptance in. The end points of the single prints are often support or resistant points as well.

Single Prints are like a gap that occurs in the middle of the day. They show a change in thinking as they seperate 2 distributions of price action with a "single" tpo (one letter)
