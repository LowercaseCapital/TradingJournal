# Poor High
A poor high is one which lacks excess and is the opposite of an excess high. A poor high will have less than two TPO’s of excess at the top of a daily range with at least two columns of TPO’s lining up to form a flat looking top. It indicates that there is supply in the high of the day area. We know this because every time prices rise to the top, they get sold quickly, thus forming the poor high.
