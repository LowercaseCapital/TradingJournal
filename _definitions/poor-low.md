# Poor Low
A poor low is one which lacks excess (2 or mote ticks) and is the opposite of an excess low. A poor low will have less than two TPO’s of excess at the bottom of a daily range with at least 2-3 columns of TPO’s lining up to form a flat looking bottom. It indicates that there are short term or weak handed shorts at that low of day area. We know this because every time prices sell off to the low, they get covered quickly, thus forming the poor low.

The poor low has two forward looking indications. The first is that prices should back away from the poor low as there are a number longs trapped at poor location. The second is that if the next day or in some subsequent session, the poor low is revisited, then the odds are strong that it will break and move lower. This is called repair as it repairs the structure of the poor low that lacked symmetry without a proper “bottom”.
