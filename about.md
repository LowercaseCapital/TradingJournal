I am just a guy named LC with no special skills that posts my notes on the S&P 500 Futures market. All analysis is my own and no I do not care if I am wrong. Here you will find a my my notes on how I prepare for a morning session and details on the trades that I took. In this business timing is everything and as such, I highly recommend you do not try to follow exactly what I do. Instead you should take inspiration from my process and make your own. What works for me will NOT work for you without a lot of practice. Even so, it may never work for you. But learn for the process and adapt it to a style that works for you. 

If you found anything helpful, please consider supporting on [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lowercasenumbers). Support is never required but is greatly appreciated and keeps me motivated to keep posting.
