# Notes
Overnight Inventory is 52% Short. 

Yesterday proved to be an interesting. After previously breaking out of balance with what seemed to be incredible strength, ES quickly found some supply to reject higher prices. After a lack luster couple of days we find ourselves firmly back into the balance zone. AS such we can continue using the balance area as key levels 4042.50 - 3938.75. Yesterday, we also filled two sets of single prints from November 30th, L and J periods so we can remove these from our key levels. Notably we still have 1 set from this day wh ich will fill at 3970.75. Look for this level in the upcoming days. 

Globex session was fairly balanced and occurred entirely within yesterdays value area. A poor high was left in W which could indicate are area of supply. Keep this is mind as the market opens. 

Today, not too much news on the horizon. The main data is Redbook at 8:55a. Lets see how the market trades back in the balance area. As always let MGI be the guide.
